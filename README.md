### I am a second year student at National Institute Of Engineering , Mysore.
#### Technology is a passion of mine and I enjoy learning new technologies and using it to solve real world problems. I love seeing the big picture mapped out for technology needs.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Dynamic Reactjs website , Designing circuit for our model to participate in SAE Aerodesign Competition and working with Azure is cool!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning and understanding maths behind back propagation algorithm,Trying my hands on Tensorflowlite to run Tiny ML Model. 
 
-  ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Deep learning , web development and IOT.
